Description: Lem semantic definition language  
 Lem is a tool for lightweight executable mathematics, for writing,
 managing, and publishing large-scale portable semantic definitions,
 with export to LaTeX, executable code (currently OCaml) and
 interactive theorem provers (currently Coq, HOL4, and Isabelle/HOL).
 .
 It is also intended as an intermediate language for generating
 definitions from domain-specific tools, and for porting definitions
 between interactive theorem proving systems.
 .
 This package contains the runtime files.
